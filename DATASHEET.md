## Motivation

### For what purpose was the dataset created?
The dataset was created to enable the development and testing of software tools designed to automate the extraction and analysis of data from incident reports, helping in law enforcement and public safety applications.

### Who created the dataset?
The dataset was likely created by a software development team, possibly within a research or academic setting, focusing on data extraction and analysis technologies.

### Who funded the creation of the dataset?
Typically, such projects could be funded by academic grants or institutional budgets.

## Composition

### What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent?
Instances in the dataset represent individual incident records extracted from various sources, likely formatted to include fields like date, time, nature of the incident, and location.

### What data does each instance consist of?
Each instance includes structured data extracted from PDFs, such as incident date and time, location, incident type, and possibly related metadata like weather conditions at the time and geographic details.

## Collection Process

### How was the data associated with each instance acquired?
Data was acquired through automated scripts that download PDFs, extract text content, and utilize external APIs to enrich the dataset with additional contextual information such as weather and location data.

## Preprocessing/Cleaning/Labeling

### Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done?
Yes, preprocessing involves normalizing date and time formats, extracting text from PDFs, and cleaning and structuring the extracted data to fit into a database schema suitable for analysis.

## Uses

### Has the dataset been used for any tasks already?
The intended use is for analyzing incident reports to support public safety and law enforcement analytics.

### What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?
Besides law enforcement support, the dataset could be used for research in public administration, urban studies, or by data science students for projects in data processing and machine learning.

## Distribution

### How will the dataset be distributed?
Such datasets could be made available through institutional repositories or shared via APIs.

## Maintenance

### Who is supporting/hosting/maintaining the dataset?
The Norman Police Dept is maintaining the dataset
